## Troubleshooting

- **Server Not Starting**: Ensure `MONGO_CONNECTION_STRING` and `ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET` are set correctly in `.env`.
- **JWT Authentication Issues**: If youâ€™re frequently redirected to log in, verify the localStorage token storage in the front end.
- **Unable to Fetch Notes**: Confirm that the backend server is running on port 8000 and that CORS is configured properly.
