## Installation Instructions
### Prerequisites
**Ensure you have the following installed:**
- Node.js (v18+)
- MongoDB (Atlas)

### Backend Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   https://github.com/karanshah1561998/EasyNotes.git
   cd easynotes
   
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd easynotes/frontend/easynotes
   npm install

   cd easynotes/backend
   npm install
   
3. **Set up environment variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the easynotes/backend directory and add:
   ```bash
   MONGO_CONNECTION_STRING = your_mongo_connection_string
   ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET = your_jwt_secret

4. **Navigate to the backend directory and start the backend server:**
   ```bash
   cd easynotes/backend
   npm run dev

5. **Navigate to the frontend/easynotes directory and start the React app:**
   ```bash
   cd easynotes/frontend/easynotes
   npm run dev
   
   Open http://localhost:5173 to view the app in your browser.

## üß© Troubleshooting

### 1. Server Not Starting
- Confirm the `.env` file exists in the backend folder.
- Ensure `MONGO_CONNECTION_STRING` and `ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET` are set correctly.
- Make sure your MongoDB cluster is accessible and not paused.

### 2. JWT Authentication Issues
- Check for expired or invalid JWT tokens.
- Make sure the token is stored correctly in `localStorage` and sent in the Authorization header.
- Verify that protected routes on the backend require authentication properly.

### 3. Notes Not Loading
- Confirm that the backend server is running at `http://localhost:8000`.
- Check that frontend API requests are targeting the correct backend URL.
- Ensure CORS is configured correctly in the Express server.

### 4. CORS Errors
- Make sure you're using the `cors` middleware in your Express app.
- Set `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` to the correct frontend origin (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`).

### 5. Environment Variables Not Working
- Restart the server after creating or updating the `.env` file.
- Double-check for typos or missing variables.
